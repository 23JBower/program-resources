## Security Steps

### Keeping Your Pins Safe

The database files should be backend and not directly accessible by the user/employee; 
employees should only be allowed to directly run dbms.py and nothing else, dbms.py will 
retrieve any additional data from the backend for them.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.
